1. Generate a new SSH key (if you donâ€™t already have one):

If you don't already have an SSH key, you can generate a new one by running:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

2. Follow the prompts to save the key to the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) and to enter a passphrase if desired.

Add your SSH key to the ssh-agent:

Start the ssh-agent in the background and add your SSH key:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


3. Add the SSH key to your GitHub account:

    Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:
	
	cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	
	Log in to your GitHub account.

    Go to Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key.

    Paste your key into the "Key" field and give it a recognizable title.

    Click Add SSH key.
	
3. Test your SSH connection:	

Test the SSH connection to GitHub:


ssh -T git@github.com

You should see a message like:


Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

5. Configure your Git repository to use SSH:

Ensure your Git repository is configured to use the SSH URL instead of the HTTPS URL. You can update the remote URL using:


git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git



6. Verify your remote URL:

Verify that the remote URL is correctly set:

git remote -v


7. Try cloning or pulling the repository again:

Now, try cloning the repository or pulling the changes again:

git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
